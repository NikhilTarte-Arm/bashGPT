Each block shows timing results for several functions.

Please calculate the average of each \"time/iter\" value (e.g., 99.34us), and iter/sec(e.g., 13.75 K,M) and return the final result in the same benchmark table format for each sub benchmark, preserving the structure, headers, and alignment of the original output. 
Do not explain anything â€” just return the formatted benchmark result table along with the column header.

Here is the data:
